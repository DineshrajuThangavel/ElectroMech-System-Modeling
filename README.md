# ðŸ”‹ Battery-Motor Simulation

This project models and simulates the dynamic interaction between a DC motor and a lithium-ion battery using Python. It implements a state-space approach to solve the system numerically and analyze key variables such as angular velocity, current, voltage, and battery SoC (State of Charge).

## ðŸ§ª Features
- State-space formulation of motor and battery systems
- Numerical integration using `solve_ivp` (RK45)
- Variable external torque input
- High-resolution plots of system behavior
- Adaptive time-step visualization

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `Solution_code_Python_Dinesh.py`: Full Python implementation
- `Solution_Report_Dinesh.pdf`: Report with figures and mathematical models
- `Task.pdf`: Original task description

## ðŸ“Š Outputs
- Angular velocity vs time (with and without load)
- State of charge vs time
- Current & voltage vs time
- Adaptive time-step profile

## ðŸ“š Technologies Used
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy)
- Runge-Kutta method for solving ODEs
- State-space modeling

## ðŸŽ“ Academic Context
This project was developed as part of a programming assignment in a Master's level engineering course on system modeling and numerical simulation.
